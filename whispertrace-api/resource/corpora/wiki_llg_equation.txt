Gilbert, is a name used for a differential equation describing the dynamics (typically the precessional motion) of magnetization M in a solid.
It is a modified version by Gilbert of the original equation of Landau and Lifshitz.
[1] The LLG equation is similar to the Bloch equation, but they differ in the form of the damping term.
The LLG equation describes a more general scenario of magnetization dynamics beyond the simple Larmor precession.
In particular, the effective field driving the precessional motion of M is not restricted to real magnetic fields; it incorporates a wide range of mechanisms including magnetic anisotropy, exchange interaction, and so on.
The various forms of the LLG equation are commonly used in micromagnetics to model the effects of a magnetic field and other magnetic interactions on ferromagnetic materials.
It provides a practical way to model the time-domain behavior of magnetic elements.
Recent developments generalizes the LLG equation to include the influence of spin-polarized currents in the form of spin-transfer torque.
[2] Landau–Lifshitz equation[edit] The terms of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation: precession (red) and damping (blue).
The trajectory of the magnetization (dotted spiral) is drawn under the simplifying assumption that the effective field Heff is constant.
In a ferromagnet, the magnitude of the magnetization M at each spacetime point is approximated by the saturation magnetization Ms (although it can be smaller when averaged over a chunk of volume).
The LLG equation describes the rotation of the magnetization in response to the effective field Heff and accounts for not only a real magnetic field but also internal magnetic interactions such as exchange and anisotropy.
To solve this equation, additional conditions for the demagnetizing field must be included to accommodate the geometry of the material.
{\displaystyle \gamma '={\frac {\gamma }{1+\gamma ^{2}\eta ^{2}M_{s}^{2}}}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad \lambda ={\frac {\gamma ^{2}\eta }{1+\gamma ^{2}\eta ^{2}M_{s}^{2}}}.
} In this form of the LL equation, the precessional term γ' depends on the damping term.
This better represents the behavior of real ferromagnets when the damping is large.
[4][5] Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert–Slonczewski equation[edit] In 1996 John Slonczewski expanded the model to account for the spin-transfer torque, i.
the torque induced upon the magnetization by spin-polarized current flowing through the ferromagnet.

Here G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is the effective internal field, including the magnetic field and contributions from exchange, anisotropy, and magnetoelastic effects.
Using the variational principle, the equations of motion can be recast into a Lagrangian form.
This makes possible a consistent derivation of the equations of motion of the magnetization field and other fields to which it may be coupled (e.
, the displacement field of the lattice and the electromagnetic field).
It also permits the introduction of viscous damping effects in a consistent manner using the Rayleigh dissipation function.
It is shown that viscous damping of the magnetization fields leads to an equation of motion which reduces to the Landau-Lifshitz equation only when the damping is small.
It is also shown that this Lagrangian formalism permits the introduction of damping due to disaccomodation in a consistent and very general way.

Gilbert could not fit Kelly's experiments with fixed usual gyromagnetic ratio γ and a frequency-dependent λ=αγ, but could fit that data for a fixed Gilbert gyromagnetic ratio γG=γ/(1+α2) and a frequency-dependent α.
Values of α as large as 9 were required, indicating very broad absorption, and thus a relatively low-quality sample.
Modern samples, when analyzed from resonance absorption, give α's on the order of 0.

Here G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is the effective internal field, including the magnetic field and contributions from exchange, anisotropy, and magnetoelastic effects.
Using the variational principle, the equations of motion can be recast into a Lagrangian form.
This makes possible a consistent derivation of the equations of motion of the magnetization field and other fields to which it may be coupled (e.
, the displacement field of the lattice and the electromagnetic field).
It also permits the introduction of viscous damping effects in a consistent manner using the Rayleigh dissipation function.
It is shown that viscous damping of the magnetization fields leads to an equation of motion which reduces to the Landau-Lifshitz equation only when the damping is small.
It is also shown that this Lagrangian formalism permits the introduction of damping due to disaccomodation in a consistent and very general way.

Gilbert, is a name used for a differential equation describing the dynamics (typically the precessional motion) of magnetization M in a solid.
It is a modified version by Gilbert of the original equation of Landau and Lifshitz.
[1] The LLG equation is similar to the Bloch equation, but they differ in the form of the damping term.
The LLG equation describes a more general scenario of magnetization dynamics beyond the simple Larmor precession.
In particular, the effective field driving the precessional motion of M is not restricted to real magnetic fields; it incorporates a wide range of mechanisms including magnetic anisotropy, exchange interaction, and so on.
The various forms of the LLG equation are commonly used in micromagnetics to model the effects of a magnetic field and other magnetic interactions on ferromagnetic materials.
It provides a practical way to model the time-domain behavior of magnetic elements.
Recent developments generalizes the LLG equation to include the influence of spin-polarized currents in the form of spin-transfer torque.
[2] Landau–Lifshitz equation[edit] The terms of the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation: precession (red) and damping (blue).
The trajectory of the magnetization (dotted spiral) is drawn under the simplifying assumption that the effective field Heff is constant.
In a ferromagnet, the magnitude of the magnetization M at each spacetime point is approximated by the saturation magnetization Ms (although it can be smaller when averaged over a chunk of volume).
The LLG equation describes the rotation of the magnetization in response to the effective field Heff and accounts for not only a real magnetic field but also internal magnetic interactions such as exchange and anisotropy.
To solve this equation, additional conditions for the demagnetizing field must be included to accommodate the geometry of the material.
{\displaystyle \gamma '={\frac {\gamma }{1+\gamma ^{2}\eta ^{2}M_{s}^{2}}}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad \lambda ={\frac {\gamma ^{2}\eta }{1+\gamma ^{2}\eta ^{2}M_{s}^{2}}}.
} In this form of the LL equation, the precessional term γ' depends on the damping term.
This better represents the behavior of real ferromagnets when the damping is large.
[4][5] Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert–Slonczewski equation[edit] In 1996 John Slonczewski expanded the model to account for the spin-transfer torque, i.
the torque induced upon the magnetization by spin-polarized current flowing through the ferromagnet.

Gilbert could not fit Kelly's experiments with fixed usual gyromagnetic ratio γ and a frequency-dependent λ=αγ, but could fit that data for a fixed Gilbert gyromagnetic ratio γG=γ/(1+α2) and a frequency-dependent α.
Values of α as large as 9 were required, indicating very broad absorption, and thus a relatively low-quality sample.
Modern samples, when analyzed from resonance absorption, give α's on the order of 0.

257S, writes “As was first pointed out by J.
Slonczewski, the observed torque peak can be interpreted in terms of rotational switching effects (abrupt reorientations of M) which must occur when K/M ≤ H ≤ 2K/M.
” Therefore the interpretation given by Gilbert was not universally accepted.

Here G {\displaystyle {\mathcal {G}}} is the effective internal field, including the magnetic field and contributions from exchange, anisotropy, and magnetoelastic effects.
Using the variational principle, the equations of motion can be recast into a Lagrangian form.
This makes possible a consistent derivation of the equations of motion of the magnetization field and other fields to which it may be coupled (e.
, the displacement field of the lattice and the electromagnetic field).
It also permits the introduction of viscous damping effects in a consistent manner using the Rayleigh dissipation function.
It is shown that viscous damping of the magnetization fields leads to an equation of motion which reduces to the Landau-Lifshitz equation only when the damping is small.
It is also shown that this Lagrangian formalism permits the introduction of damping due to disaccomodation in a consistent and very general way.
